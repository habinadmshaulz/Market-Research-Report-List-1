<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck engine brake market primarily consists of two types: compression release brakes and exhaust brakes. Compression release brakes, commonly known as jake brakes, utilize the engine's compression cycle to slow down the vehicle, providing significant braking force. Exhaust brakes, on the other hand, work by restricting exhaust flow, increasing back pressure, which decelerates the engine. Both systems enhance vehicle control, reduce brake wear, and improve safety during heavy-duty operations, making them essential in the trucking industry.</p></p>
